# random-forest.

Random Forest algorithm is a powerful tree learning technique in Machine Learning. It works by creating a number of Decision Trees during the training phase. Each tree is constructed using a random subset of the data set to measure a random subset of features in each partition. This randomness introduces variability among individual trees, reducing the risk of overfitting and improve prediction
